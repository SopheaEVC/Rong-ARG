# Rong-ARG
This file aims to create Koh Rong Archipelegos. 
The project uses Shapefiles from [OpenDevelopment Cambodia](https://data.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/dataset/administrative-boundaries-of-cambodia-2014) Website.

Sub-national Administrative Boundaries contain __three__ files:
1. province.geojson
2. district.geojson
3. commune.geojson

- These data files located in [sfdata_v2](https://github.com/SopheaEVC/Rong-ARG/tree/main/sf_data) folder. 
- Map design concept was inspired by [GorkyFlorez](https://github.com/GorkyFlorez/Mapa_Ubicacion_Cuenca/blob/main/Mapa%20de%20clasificacion.png).
